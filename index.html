<h1>Tim King's Website</h1>
<p>Welcome! I'm a maths PhD student at King's College London. My advisor is 
 <a href="https://nms.kcl.ac.uk/john.armstrong/">John Armstrong</a>, and I have also worked with
 <a href="https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/statistics/staff/academic-research/mijatovic/">Aleksandar MijatoviÄ‡</a>
 </p>
<p> You can send me an email: tim dot mysurname at kcl dot ac dot uk </p>
<h2> Research </h2>
<p>I'm interested in stochastic processes on manifolds. I also have a side interest in statistics and machine learning.
More details to be added soon (although, as someone once said, "Even the worst TV shows never excuse themselves with an
 'Under Construction' sign.")</p>
 <strong> Papers </strong>
 <p>Curved Schemes for Simulating SDEs on Manifolds. Preprint, will be on ArXiv soon. You can email me if you need a draft copy. </p>
 <p> Anomalous Recurrence of Markov Chains on Negative Curvature Manifolds. Preprint. Again, email me if you need a draft copy. </p>
