<h2>Question</h2>
  
<p>Suppose we have some data $x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n$ and $y_1, y_2, \dots y_n$. 
Then we can calculate the regression line of $y$ on $x$. 
Let's say that we get $y=mx+c$, and rearrange to get $x=\frac{1}{m}y - \frac{c}{m}$.
Is this the regression line of $x$ on $y$? </p>

  <h2> Answer </h2>
  In general, no. For simplicity assume that $\sum x_i = \sum y_i = 0$. Then it is intuitively clear (and true!) that
  $c=0$ for both regression lines. Let's find For the regression line of $y$ on $x$ we get $y=mx$ where
 
  \[ m = argmin(\sum_{i,j} (y_i - x_{ij} x_{j})^2) = \frac{x_i y_i}{\sqrt{x_i x_i} \sqrt{y_i y_i}} \sqrt{\frac{y_i y_i}{x_i x_i}} \]
  
  hence, a necessary and sufficent condition for the regression of $x$ on $y$ to be the reciprocal of this is that the 
  correlation coefficient between $x$ and $y$ be $\pm 1$.
  

<h2>Discussion</h2>

<p>What is wrong with the following argument? "Comparing the scatterplots of $x vs y$ and $y vs x$, we see that they are
  related by reflecting in the line $y=x$. This is an isometry, and hence the best line for regressing $y$ on $x$ will be
  transformed to the best line for regressing $x$ on $y$. Since $y=mx$ gets sent to $\tilde{y}=\frac{1}{m} \tilde{x}$ we
  do indeed just take the reciprocal gradient as expected." </p>
  
  <p> I believe that the answer is that we are solving two <strong>different</strong> optimisation problems when regressing
    $x$ on $y$ vs $y$ on $x$. One aims to minimise the sum of squared lengths of some <strong>vertical</strong> line segments,
    whilst the other aims to minimise the sum of squared lengths of <strong>horizontal</strong> line segments. </p>
